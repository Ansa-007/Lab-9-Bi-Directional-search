# Professional Bi-Directional Search Implementation

A comprehensive, industry-level implementation of bi-directional search algorithms with advanced visualization, performance benchmarking, and interactive demonstrations.

## Overview

This laboratory provides a complete framework for understanding and implementing bi-directional search algorithms, which simultaneously search from both the start and goal nodes to significantly improve search efficiency over traditional unidirectional approaches.

## Features

- **Core Algorithm Implementation**: Optimized bi-directional search with multiple heuristics
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive benchmarking and comparison tools
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time search process visualization
- **Multiple Graph Types**: Support for weighted, unweighted, directed, and undirected graphs
- **Industry Applications**: Real-world use cases and scenarios
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based system for custom heuristics and strategies

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from bidirectional_search import BiDirectionalSearch, GraphGenerator

# Create a sample graph
graph = GraphGenerator.create_random_graph(1000, 0.1)

# Initialize bi-directional search
search = BiDirectionalSearch(graph)

# Find path between nodes
result = search.find_path(0, 999)
print(f"Path found: {result.path}")
print(f"Nodes explored: {result.nodes_explored}")
print(f"Time taken: {result.time_taken:.4f}s")
```
